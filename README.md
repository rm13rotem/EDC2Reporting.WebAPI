# EDC2Reporting
Clinical Trial Management System - EDC (electronic data capture) to Reporting (Listing and Tabulation)

This repository is all about Clinical Trials. 
Want to set up a new clinical trial in just a couple of clicks? You got it.
Want to use state of the art HTML files as your CRF modules for designing your trial? You got it.
Want to conduct a clinical trial for free and see the results online all accross the web, as they occur, giving view permission to your IRB,
sponsor, data monitors and so on? You got it.
Want to contribute a new Module and benefit all of mankind, stating your name in the readme.md file of your folder, thus placing yourself in
the hall of fame for all of time? You got it.
Want to purchase a new pharma company and run a clinical trial off the books to see what her true worth is before sealing the "due 
diligence"? clause? No problem. You got it. 
Want to save on heavy duty medical dictionaries for adverse events and replace them with our local version of free dictionary, saving you 
millions of dollars? You got it.

The software is given AS IS without any warranty whatsoever. It is completely in .net (C#), and is intended to be as simple as possible, giving you many simple, yet 
effective ways to go. You can set up your main entities (Doctors, Patients, Visits, Modules, etc.) in simple JSON files, or you can use 
a database of your choise.

The clinical trial has two parts - collecting the data electronically (EDC) and traditionally after all is said and done, running reports 
on the sealed data (Reporting). We offer a completely radical new approach. Everything is online. You can see your listings and tabulations
as they occur, and all this without writing a single line of code. We encourage you to sign up for free, and start honing your GCP (Good
Clinical Practice) skills on our trainging site. We encourage you to set up your clinical trial for free over there.
